# Pneumonia classification model based on chest X-ray images using ResNet-50

This repository contains a pneumonia classification model based on chest X-ray images. The model is built on top of a ResNet-50 architecture, which is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of image classification tasks.

The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 chest X-ray images, including both normal and pneumonia cases. The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the held-out test set.

## Potential applications: 

Clinical diagnosis: This model can be used to help clinicians diagnose pneumonia more accurately and efficiently.
Screening: This model can be used to develop new screening tools for pneumonia, which could help to reduce the burden of this disease.
Research: This model can be used to study the features of chest X-ray images that are most predictive of pneumonia. This information could be used to develop new diagnostic and screening tools, as well as to develop new treatments for pneumonia.
Instructions:

To use the model, simply clone this repository and install the required dependencies. Then, you can load the model and predict the probability of pneumonia for a given chest X-ray image.

## Disclaimer:

This model is still under development and should not be used as a replacement for a diagnosis from a qualified medical professional.
